- Lecture on physically based volume rendering (how to interpret volumetric data as a physical quantity so that we can use light transport methods to visualize them) ~ 1 hour
- Lecture on Polyphorm/PolyPhy (motivation, history, methodology, scientific results, spinoff art, future directions) ~ 1 hour
- Praktikum on volume vis (detailed analysis of existing visualizations and brainstorming around it motivated by Tufte's canon, hands-on exercise in Python on doing a custom volume vis either using something readily available like Napari or even manually coding a GPU raymarching shader in Taichi) ~ 1.5 hours (or maybe 2 hours if I can think of something around manual sketching in the meantime, not sure yet)
- Workshop on PolyPhy (having a few sample datasets, loading them up and reconstructing & visualizing the underlying networks) ~ 1.5 hours
